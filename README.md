### Student Performance Analysis and Predictive Modeling
This project aims to analyze student performance data, identify key patterns, and build predictive models to forecast future student outcomes based on various factors. The project is divided into two main sections:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Initial exploration of the dataset to understand underlying trends, distributions, and relationships.
Model Training – Building and evaluating machine learning models to predict student performance.

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository (if hosted online):

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd student-performance-analysis
Install dependencies: Ensure Python 3.x and pip are installed. Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Alternatively, the required libraries can be manually installed, e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.)

Data Preparation: Place the dataset in the data/ folder. If the dataset requires preprocessing, run the EDA notebook first.

Data Description
The dataset includes features related to student demographics, academic records, attendance, and more. Key variables include:

Demographics: Age, gender, and other personal information.
Academic Data: Scores across subjects, past academic performance.
Behavioral Data: Attendance rates, study hours, and extracurricular activities.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the 1. EDA STUDENT PERFORMANCE.ipynb notebook, we performed:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
Removing outliers and scaling numerical data.
Univariate and Bivariate Analysis:

Distribution plots for individual features.
Correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables.
Key Insights:

Identified features that significantly correlate with academic performance.
Explored the impact of demographics and behavior on grades.
Model Training
In the 2. MODEL TRAINING.ipynb notebook, we:

Feature Selection and Engineering:

Selected important features from EDA for training.
Engineered new features to improve model accuracy.
Model Selection:

Tested multiple models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine).
Performed hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation.
Evaluation Metrics:

Evaluated models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Selected the best-performing model for deployment.
Results
Model Performance:
The model achieved high accuracy in predicting student performance, with [specific metrics here].
Insights:
Notable factors influencing performance were [feature insights here, e.g., attendance, study hours].
Conclusion
This project successfully highlights the predictive power of various academic, demographic, and behavioral factors on student performance. The model built can be used to support educational institutions in identifying at-risk students and fostering targeted interventions.

Future Work
Data Collection: Gather more data for longitudinal analysis.
Feature Expansion: Incorporate additional features like parental education and school resources.
Model Deployment: Deploy the model as an interactive tool for educators.
